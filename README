# jquery.sorty.js

Sorty is a lighweight jQuery plugin that enable a group of DOM elements to be sortable via drag an drop on mobile and desktop devices.

Sorty was build out of a need for easy supporting drag-sorting on mobile devices with touch events without having to depend on huge libraries out there. 

Evendo Sorty was intented for mobile devices it also supports ordinery desktop browsers so feel free to use it for anything.

This plugin was build on top of the awesome new and lightweight jquery.pep.js plugin by Brian Gonzalez (https://github.com/briangonzalez/pep.jquery.js).

## How to use

You have this in your html:

```
	<ul>
	<li>List item 1</li>
	<li>List item 2</li>
	<li>List item 3</li>
	<li>List item 4</li>
	<li>List item 5</li>
	</ul>
```

So just do this:

```
	<script>
	
	$('ul').sorty();

	</script>
```

This will make all your li elements to be drag-sortable
